# spacecraft-shooter
In the computer graphics course, I completed an individual gaming  project whose name was Aircraft Shooter. 
It was such type of a game  where different kinds of enemies would come horizontally to destroy the  main aircraft, as a result, the life support of the main aircraft would  decrease. 
But if the main aircraft had shot the selected enemy craft its  points would have increased dramatically to a peak. 
This game was  controlled by a mouse and keyboard on both sides. There were also  many preeminent features. 
Finally, this game was made by OpenGL (.CPP) and the platform was Code :: Blocks.
